# Archive Notice

This repository contains my comprehensive LeetCode journey with **250+ solved problems**, each documented with multiple approaches from naive to optimal solutions. Every problem has been carefully analyzed and explained to build strong problem-solving fundamentals.

## Why This Repo is Now Archived

After maintaining this repository extensively, today on 1st Decemeber 2025 I've decided to **pause active documentation** here. While thorough documentation has been invaluable for learning, it's time-consuming, and I need to shift gears:

- ✅ **Fundamentals built** - The structured approach served its purpose
- 🚀 **Speed over documentation** - Moving faster in my problem-solving journey
- 🏆 **Competitive Programming focus** - Taking CP seriously now
- ⚡ **Efficiency prioritized** - Documentation slows down practice velocity

## Going Forward

I will **only commit to this repo** for exceptionally important topics that warrant detailed documentation.

For my ongoing LeetCode practice, I've created a new repository: **[LeetCode Sprint](https://github.com/aryan04-t/LeetCode-Sprint)**

### What to Expect in LeetCode Sprint:
- Quick commits
- Code records without detailed explanations could be present 
- Maintenance and organization I would prefer, but can't promise due to time constraints - but I will try my best to maintain it as much as possible 
- Raw solutions can also be commited 
- But I will try to keep it structured as much as possible until my velocity of learning is not being hindered

* This repo will remain as a structured, high-quality archive of my earlier problem-solving journey — something I can revisit for revision and reference.

**Note:** This is an archive, not an abandonment. I will keep adding quality documentation when I feel its important and if I get time.
