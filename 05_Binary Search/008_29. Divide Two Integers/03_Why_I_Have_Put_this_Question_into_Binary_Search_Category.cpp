# Why I have put this Question into "Binary Search Category": 

1. This question is not a "Binary Search Question" 
2. This is a "Bit Manipulation Question", and every other approach that I have used for solving this question until now, all those approaches are invalid approaches. 
3. The usage of divison operator is not allowed for solving this question, because the question explicitly mentions not to use the division operator, that's why my first "Division Operator Approach" is invalid. 
4. The subtraction approach is a valid approach, but you get "Time Limit Exceeded Error" when you use it, because it is a very naive approach. 
5. The binary search approach passes all the test cases, and it is a good approach, but again, the binary search approach also uses multiplication operator, and the question mentions not to use the multiplication operator also, so this one is also a invalid approach  
6. All the above approaches even use "long long" datatype, and the question has mentioned not to use that also, the question clearly mentions, "Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range" 

--> But still, before learning the "Bit Manipulation Approach", I wanted to try all these approaches once, as all of these appraoches clicked in my mind on my own, and the binary search approach is also an "Intutive One", and that's also the reason I have put this question into the "Binary Search Folder"
