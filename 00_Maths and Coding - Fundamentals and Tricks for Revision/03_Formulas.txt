1. Sum of all natural numbers from 1 to n = (n * (n+1))/2 


2. Sum of all natural numbers from 1 to n-1 = ((n-1) * n)/2 
--> This formula is derived from above one  


3. Total number of pairs that can be formed between n items = ((n-1) * n)/2 
--> This is formula is also obviously derived from 1st formula
