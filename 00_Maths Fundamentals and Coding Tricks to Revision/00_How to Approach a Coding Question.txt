# How to Approach a Coding Problem: 

1. Read question, figure out the nature of question and figure out the data structure and concepts which will be used to solve it 
2. Read constraints 
3. Check Base Cases 
4. Now Start from most fundamental test case, and build 3-4 different variety of test cases which take all the edge cases and general cases in account 
5. Now spot the pattern and the algorithm which will be used 
6. Build the logic and generalize the approach 
7. Code your solution (Typing your code should be the least effort work in this whole process, "Build Logics and Recognise Patterns") 
8. Dry Run the Code, and Debug it.
