1. Sum of all natural numbers from 1 to n = (n * (n+1))/2 


2. Sum of all natural numbers from 1 to n-1 = ((n-1) * n)/2 
--> This formula is derived from above one  


3. Total number of pairs that can be formed between n items = ((n-1) * n)/2 
--> This is formula is also obviously derived from 1st formula  


4. Sum of any 2 sides of a triangle is always greater than the 3rd side (a + b > c && b + c > a && c + a > b => then only it could be a triangle)
