# Factorial: 


5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 

--> 5 people can be arranged in 5! ways

# Definition of Permutation and Combination: 


* Permutation means "Arrangement", here order matters, and Combination means "Selection", here order doesn't matter.

# Examples: 


* You have 5 students and 3 chairs, when you're told to arrange 5 students on these 3 chairs, then we use permutation because here order matters. 

* And when you're told that just select any 3 students out of the 5 students, then we use combination formula, because here we just want to select the students, the arrangement among them doesn't matter. 


--> Much more realistic example will be, the name of 5 students is [sohan, mohan, ram, shyam, lakhan] if I want to arrange 5 of these students on 3 chairs, then here when I say order matters, then it simply means: 

-> If ram sits on 1st chair, shyam sits on 2nd chair, and lakhan sits on 3rd then this is one arrangement 
-> If shyam sits on 1st chair, ram sits on 2nd chair, and lakhan sits on 3rd then this is another arrangement 
-> and If lakhan sits on 1st chair, ram sits on 2nd chair, and shyam sits on 3rd then this is another arrangement 

So, basically here the 3 people are same, but we just saw that they can be arranged in themselves and because in permutation order matters, that's why every time it is a new arrangement. So, here in this scenario we use nPr formula, we want to find the permutation of students here, because order matters here. 


--> But when we say select 3 students out of these 5 students, then we simply want to say, the order of arrangement among them doesn't matter, if you choose (ram, shyam, lakhan) then it is same as selecting (shyam, ram, lakhan) or selecting (lakhan, ram, shyam), the people at the end we get after this selection or same people, in which order you select them it doesn't matter, and in this scenario we use combination formula (nCr). 




@ Note: 

$ That's why Combination's answer will always be less than permutation's answer, when the scenario is same.

# Formulas: 


--> Permutation Formula = nPr = n!/(n-r)! 

--> Combination Formula = nCr = n!/((n-r)!*r!)  

--> nPr = nCr * r!
