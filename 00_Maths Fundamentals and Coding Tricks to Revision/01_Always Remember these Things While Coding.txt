# Always Keep in Mind: 


1. Never forget writing base case in recursion 

2. Never forget incremeting/decrementing the loop control variable in while loop 

3. Never forget "new" keyword always returns a memory address, use pointer with it 

4. And whenever you allocate memory dynamically using the new keyword, never forget to use the delete keyword and free the memory explicitly
